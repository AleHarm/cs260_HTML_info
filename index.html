        <p>
          Hi there! My name is Alex, I'm a computer science major at BYU with a 
          software engineering emphasis! I'm from Redmond, Oregon although it's 
          been a while since I've been there. I've been married for about 6 months now
          and I work as a handyman for Moxie Pest Control. I also run all the AV for their
          events, but my techncial job description is Handyman.
        </p>
        <p>
          I play a lot of different instruments, none very well, but what I lack in skill I
          make up for in sheer number of instruments! Tenor Saxophone, didgeridoo, drum set, all
          other percussion instruments, piano, harmonica, Orba, kalimba, you name it, I've tried 
          it. I also am a passionate Magic: The Gathering player, both paper and virtual.
          Green mage for life!
